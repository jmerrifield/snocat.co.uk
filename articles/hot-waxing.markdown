# How-to: Hot wax your base

Waxing is probably the single most important factor in getting the most out of your board. Without wax, your base would quickly dry out and offer no lubrication to help you get around the slopes. Eventually it would allow water ingress into the core and a ruined board. Even when waxed, the type of wax used can have a dramatic effect on the performance of your board. There are a number of articles in the <a href="../tuningindex.php">tuning</a> section to help you decide which type of wax is best for you. This article explains the basic process of hot waxing a snowboard.

## Equipment

* Base cleaner (if changing wax type -see Step 1a)
* Wax
* Iron (any iron will do, pereferably one with no holes in the bottom)
* Structure brush
* Wax scraper
* Fibretex pad

## Instructions

### Step 1a: Cleaning/Conditioning the board - using solvent

![Step 1a](/Images/hotwaxing1a_Large.jpg)

When changing the wax from warm or regular to cold or vice versa then it may be desirable to aggressively clean out the base with solvent base cleaner. The downside of this is that in order to build up the wax within the base structure several hot wax applications and scrapes of the board will be necessary or use Dominator Renew (as if <a href="newboardsetup.php">treating a new board</a>). To use the base cleaner, spray it generously onto the base of the board generously and brush aggressively with the structure brush. Leave this to 'soak up' the old wax for a few minutes. Now drag the wax scraper firmly down the length of the board, this will have the effect of pulling the partially-dissolved old wax from the base structure. Now give the base another brush and wipe with kitchen roll to clean away the last of the old wax + solvent.

### Step 1b: Cleaning/Conditioning the board - hot wax and warm scrape

If you are using the same temperature wax as is on the board already, it is usually sufficient to hot wax the board and scrape and brush it while the wax is still warm. This process effectively 'rinses' the dirty wax out of the base and prevents the wax being entirely removed from the base. 

### Step 2: Apply wax

Switch the iron on and wait for it to heat up. It should be hot enough to easily melt the wax, but not so much that it is continuously smoking (a few wisps of smoke are OK, the 'wool' setting on most irons seems to achieve a good temperature!). We don't recommed using this iron on your good shirts from now on! 

To apply wax to the board, hold the iron vertically above the board with the wax pressed against the iron. Move the iron around so that the drops of melted wax spread evenly across the base of the board. Alternatively you can briefly hold the wax against the base of the iron, then rub the softened wax block onto the board. Keep doing this until the whole base is covered with a very thin layer of wax. This results in much less wasted wax, but can be a pain if you're using very hard wax. This process is known as 'chequerboarding' if you make a chequerboard pattern, and can save lots of money if using very expensive race wax. 

### Step 3: Iron-in the wax

Now that the board is covered in wax you need to iron it into the base. By heating the base and simultaneously melting the layer of wax on top, you allow the wax to seep into the porous base structure, where it will continuously lubricate the base to keep it in good condition and keep you moving on the snow. 

Starting at one end of the board, move the iron slowly in small circles, using a firm even pressure. Once the wax has melted thoroughly, move along slightly. Ideally you should get the base nice and hot for maximum wax absorbtion, but be careful not to overheat it! You should just about be able to feel the heat on the other side of the board (the topsheet) but do not let the base get any hotter than this! Take care where the tips of the board curve up because this is the thinnest point of the board and can easily get too hot. It can also be tricky around the binding inserts as the metal threads conduct heat away from the base, and they are often slightly recessed due to the forces exerted by the bindings when riding hard. 

### Step 4: Wait!

Once the wax has been thoroughly ironed in to the base, the whole board should feel slightly warm to the touch. It takes a while for the wax to cool down enough to scrape, so is best to leave the board for at least a few hours. If the wax is still warm when you scrape it, it will simply get pulled out of the base, undoing all your hard work! This is a desirable effect when cleaning the board with a hot-wax-and-scrape as in Step 2a, but not here. 

### Step 5: Scrape

![Step 5](/Images/hotwaxing5_Large.jpg)

Scraping off the excess wax is a fairly simple process, just use the edge of the wax scraper to... scrape! Use whatever angle and direction seems most effective, the idea is to remove as much wax as possible without damaging the base so just keep going until hardly any wax is coming off. If you're dong this in your living room it's a good idea to try and catch the scrapings in something so they don't end up all over the floor! When the base has been scraped, use the square cutout in the corner of your scraper to scrape off any wax from the edges. 

### Step 6: Structure

![Step 6](/Images/hotwaxing6_Large.jpg)

Now the obvious amounts of excess wax have been removed by scraping, it's time to scrub the wax we don't want out of the grooves in the board base. Snowboards have these grooves running along them to break water surface tension and stop you getting sucked down onto wet snow, so it's important to keep them clear. 

Use the structure brush to vigorously scrub the base of the board. Do this first in a lengthways direction, then at 45 degrees in either direction. Keep brushing until no more wax particles appear. 

To finish off, wipe the board with the fibretex pad for a shiny base and to break up static electricity between your base and the snow.
